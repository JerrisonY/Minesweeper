# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a puzzle game where players navigate a grid-based game board filled with hidden mines. The objective is to uncover all the cells on the board that do not contain mines without triggering any mines. Players must deduce the locations of the mines based on numerical clues provided by the revealed cells.
## Getting Started

Click the tiles to reveal either a mine or numerical value. *Tip: You want to avoid the mines!*  

The numbers will represent how many mines are 1 tile adjacent to the current tile. Using this information deduce where the mines are on the grid. Once you find a potential mine, right click to flag it for future reference. Reveal all tiles without hitting a mine to win.

There are 3 difficulties, choose one and get started!
