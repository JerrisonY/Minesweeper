*** Minesweeper with flood mechanic ***

** Rules **
- A board will be presented with hidden tiles
- Try to click all the tiles that do not have any mines
- if you click a mine, you lose
- if you successfully click all the tiles without mines, you win



** In-depth Mechanics **
- Typically there will be 3 board sizes
    - beginner: 8x8 (10 mines)
    - intermediate: 16x16 (40 mines)
    - expert: 30x16 or 16x30 (99 mines)

- Tiles will either display one of 3 values:
    - mine
    - blank (meaning no mines are nearby)
    - a number (displaying how many mines are close to the tile within 1 tiles distance)

- Flood mechanic
    - if the user clicks on an empty tile (with no mine or number value) it will reveal all tiles within 1 tile radius of it (continuing in all fronts until a number values is revealed)



** JS Logic **
- start button to render the board (size to be determined)
    - display:grid with 1fr on both row and column
        - this'll be a problem if chosen to do expert mode (30x16) because it's not a perfect square board, hence tiles will be lopsided if 1fr
    - create element div for each tile using a for loop
        - a for loop within a for loop to create an array of arrays (rows and columns)
        - give each new div a id or its row and column (id="0-1")

- run mine function first to populate the board with mines randomly 
    - use a Math.random() to roll a random number (number of times based on mine quantity)
    - use a condition to make sure it's not assigning a mine on a tile that already has one
        - assign the mine tile with a dataset or class "mine"

- assign each remaining tile a class and/or dataset to determine if the tile is a number/empty value
    - set a condition: if tile is 1 square adjacent to a mine, display the number of mines
        - if not, set it to '' value
        - condition check eg: if board[r-1][c-1] and so forth and so forth 

- implement a flag function
    - look into right clicking and capturing the windowEventElement to add a flag on right click
    - or toggle button that turns user on click tile to change the tile to a flag icon

- flood mechanic
    - use recursion to rerun the check mine function if there isn't any mines/number value on the tile clicked. This will in turn keep checking every adjacent tile until a number value is found and it'll stop

- once all tiles are revealed show winner in title text
